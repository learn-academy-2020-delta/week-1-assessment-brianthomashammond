# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a repeatable set of actions performed on data. You use them to quickly, efficiently, and reliably perform tasks.

  Researched answer: Functions require an input and give an output related to that input.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() performs a certain operation on each element of an array and returns a new array with the results of those operations. A .map() array will be the same size as the original array.

  .filter() checks if each element of an array meets a certain criteria and if so, pushes that value to a new array which is returned. A .filter() array will be the same length or smaller than the original array.

  Neither .map() nor .filter() makes any change to the original array.

  Researched answer: .map(): More specifically, "a certain operation" could be a function call. The function is called on each array element in order.

  .filter(): Can return an empty array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() prints a message to the terminal based on the argument given. It is primarily used for checking and debugging code.

  return gives a value at the end of a function. That value can then be used by other functions and methods in the program.

  Researched answer: I like these.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is the specific case of a function's parameter that is used to execute the function in that instance.

  Researched answer: I think this is right. I read somewhere that in a function definition the unfilled variable is a parameter, and when a function is called the user's specific input is an argument. My google is failing me now though.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming roles consist of the navigator and the driver. It is the navigator's role to conceptualize the coding approach and articulate instructions to the driver on how to enter the code into the text editor. It is the driver's role to accurately execute the navigator's instructions.

  Researched answer: Should have added that it's both person's role to catch mistakes, debug, and keep each other on task. Also, conversing about the code can help both parties understand the code better.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is Test Driven Development. A testing file is created and yarn jest is invoked in the same directory. A test is described in the testing file with expectation examples and run in jest. When the test fails correctly, the code is written which will make the test succeed.

  Researched answer: Should have mentioned refactoring after further test fails. Also, it's probably possible to do TDD without jest.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: So much. Sooooooooo much. Everyone is really great with answering our questions, our time is respected, everyone is polite and supportive. It's great.
