# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a repeatable set of actions performed on data. You use them to quickly, efficiently, and reliably perform tasks.

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() performs a certain operation on each element of an array and returns a new array with the results of those operations. A .map() array will be the same size as the original array.

  .filter() checks if each element of an array meets a certain criteria and if so, pushes that value to a new array which is returned. A .filter() array will be the same length or smaller than the original array.

  Neither .map() nor .filter() makes any change to the original array.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() prints a message to the terminal based on the argument given. It is primarily used for checking and debugging code.

  return gives a value at the end of a function. That value can then be used by other functions and methods in the program.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming roles consist of the navigator and the driver. It is the navigator's role to conceptualize the coding approach and articulate instructions to the driver on how to enter the code into the text editor. It is the driver's role to accurately execute the navigator's instructions.

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is Test Driven Development. A testing file is created and yarn jest is invoked in the same directory. A test is described in the testing file with expectation examples and run in jest. When the test fails correctly, the code is written which will make the test succeed.
